# Organic Trail
Organic Trail was part of a class project I worked on while working on my PhD. The class was a class discussing using technology and games for teaching purposes. This was a group project and I came up with the idea and did the programming on the Hallowing. My groupmates worked on the artwork (which was great as I can’t draw to save my soul) and came up with the gameplay. The project was coded in CircuitPython. And yes, we got an A in the class.

This was a farming sim game. The idea was to teach younger kids how growing something works. Our version of the game was somewhat limited due to time constraints, but we did utilize the light sensor. They had to make sure the Hallowing was in enough light to “grow” their groups. We also had some randomness with things like insects or bad weather as well. There is more that could be done, but we hit a few obstacles. The first is the limitations of CircuitPython. As the code gets bigger, you start hitting RAM issues on these boards. There is also a limit on how many images we can store, although the Hallowing has more storage than other boards from Adafruit. But overall, we were happy with the outcome and how it turned out.
